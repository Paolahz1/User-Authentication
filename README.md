# Educational Project: User Authentication with Node.js

## What Was Used:

- Node.js and Express.js
- DBLocal
- JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- Cookies
- EJS (Embedded JavaScript)

## Information Learned Creating This Project:

### EJS (Embedded JavaScript)
EJS is a templating engine that mixes HTML code with JavaScript. It allows dynamic web page generation on the server side before sending to the client. This enables creating pages that can change based on server-side data, enhancing flexibility and rendering efficiency.

### JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
JWT is utilized for authentication through tokens. Tokens are generated and verified to authenticate users securely. They encapsulate user information and are sent between client and server, enabling stateless authentication mechanisms.

### Cookies
Cookies are used to store tokens on the client's browser, facilitating the authentication process. Compared to other methods like localStorage, cookies provide added security as they are not accessible via JavaScript from different domains, enhancing security for token storage.

### DBLocal
DBLocal provides a basic implementation of a local database. While suitable for learning and development, it is not designed for production environments due to limitations in scalability and reliability.
